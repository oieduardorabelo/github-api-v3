# ES6 with Webpack and Github API v3

Using `ES6 with Webpack`, to enable **ES6+** features with **[Babel](https://github.com/babel)** compiler

#### System Dependencies

I'm running this project with `webpack-dev-server`, please, install it globally:

```
npm i -g webpack-dev-server
```

#### Development

Inside the project folder, run these commands:

```
# to install npm dependencies
npm i

# to start the dev server
webpack-dev-server

The last command will open a dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
