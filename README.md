# ES6 with Webpack and Github API v3

#### System Dependencies

I'm running this project with `webpack-dev-server`, please, install it globally:

```
npm i -g webpack-dev-server
```

#### Development

Inside the project folder, run these commands:

```
# to install npm dependencies
npm i

# to start the dev server
webpack-dev-server
```

The last command will open a dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
